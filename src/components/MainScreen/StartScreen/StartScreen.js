                <h3>Why is Kobadoo good for your mind?</h3>
                <p>Playing memory games help sharpen certain brain functions that tend to wane with age, such as <strong>attention</strong> to detail, <strong>concentration</strong>, <strong>reaction time</strong>, <strong>decision making</strong>, and <strong>working memory</strong>. <i>Kobadoo</i> has been created in cooperation with a specialist in <strong>clinical neuropsychology</strong>.</p>

                <h3>What is the <i>working memory</i>?</h3>
                <p>Working memory is a form of short-term memory, where you temporarily hold information in your mind while processing it. When you play <i>Kobadoo</i> you are actively using your working memory. There are several scientific studies that suggest training of working memory has <strong>beneficial effects</strong> and can <strong>increase your cognitive functions</strong>. So <strong>have fun</strong> while you also train your working memory and attention!</p>

                <h3>Why should you train your <i>working memory</i>?</h3>
                <p>Some programs to train the working memory have shown improvements in everyday functioning, including your <strong>concentration</strong>. It can be especially beneficial to some clinical groups like people withÂ ADHD, that suffer impaired working memory and inattentiveness. One example is the possibility to improve the <strong>school performance</strong> of children with ADHD.</p>
                <p>Some adults have also improved their brain functions through this kind of exercises. <strong>Age-related decline</strong> can be improved by training working memory, and it can also help older adults perform everyday tasks <strong>more efficiently</strong>. Finally, some studies suggest that training your working memory can <strong>improve your mood</strong> by releasing dopamine in the brain.</p>
